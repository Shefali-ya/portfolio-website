            <h3>Animated Navigation Bar</h3>
            <p>An animated navigation bar enhances the user experience by providing dynamic interactions as users hover or click through different sections. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of an animated navigation bar:

                ### Structure
                - **Horizontal Layout**: Typically positioned at the top of the page, spanning the full width.
                - **Navigation Links**: Contains links such as "Home," "About," "Projects," and "Contact."
                - **Brand Logo**: A logo or brand name can be included on the left side.
                
                ### Animation Features
                1. **Hover Effects**:
                   - **Color Change**: The text color of the links changes on hover, providing visual feedback.
                   - **Underline Animation**: An underline appears smoothly beneath the text when hovered over.
                   - **Scaling**: The link scales up slightly (e.g., 1.1x) when hovered for a more pronounced effect.
                
                2. **Active State**:
                   - The current page link is highlighted with a distinct color or style to indicate the active section.
                
                3. **Dropdown Menus** (if applicable):
                   - Smooth slide-down effect for dropdowns on hover, revealing sub-menu items.
                   - Use of fade or slide transitions for a polished look.
                
                4. **Responsive Design**:
                   - Transitions between horizontal and vertical layouts on smaller screens.
                   - Hamburger menu icon appears for mobile views, which expands to show links when clicked.
                
                ### Implementation
                - **CSS Transitions**: Use `transition` properties for smooth animations.
                - **JavaScript/jQuery**: Optional for more complex animations or to handle active states dynamically.
                
                ### Example Use Case
                - When a user hovers over "Projects," the link could change color, an underline slides in from the left, and a small icon might appear beside the text to indicate more information is available.
                
                This animated navigation bar not only improves aesthetics but also enhances usability, guiding users intuitively through the website.
